This is the 'love' module, and is currently on hold.

The ultimate goal for this module is for it to be more than your typical
love service. The love service on most networks takes on the role of being a
bit of a joke - you can send flowers through it, and maybe get "married"..

That's pathetic!

Look at the success of all those horrible dating websites out there, why
isn't there a dating website for geeks? Because geeks are too busy in IRC.
So why not create a love service where not only can you do the usual (send
flowers, get married etc), but why not combine the power of Exordium's
backend with the concept of a "dating service", or a "cupids service".

This would require table in exordium's database for the service to store
people's "vital statistics", and information about who they're looking for
to assist a match-making engine..

The love service could then send notes to people saying its found a possible
match to their preferences and they could then go and look them up. Possibly
even DCC photos? Or perhaps just links for people..

Also would be neat if the service could introduce people if they're on-line
at the same time. Eg. someone's profile matches (in both directions), one of
the parties could get the service to introduce them or something :)
