	* source/lib/parser.cpp: 
	
	Fixed bug where services was tracking quit messages for
	non-registered nicknames which was doing unnessary db queries.
	
	See:
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=702434&group_id=30144&atid=398385

	* AUTHORS, doc/example.conf, include/exordium/config.h,
	source/lib/config.h, source/modules/mod.chan/chan.cpp,
	source/modules/mod.nick/nick.cpp: 
	
	Removed hardcoding of IRCDome/PeopleChat as the network name, now
	uses the config variable NetworkName provided by Kine (see
	example.conf)
	
	Added Scott to the authors list.

2003-03-13 11:17  ircdome

	* source/lib/channel.cpp: 
	
	Fixed bug where +r wasn't being removed on a channel drop.
	
	See
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=702845&group_id=30144&atid=398385

2003-03-13 11:12  ircdome

	* source/lib/channel.cpp: 
	
	Fixed bug with registering channels where +r wasn't being set.
	
	See
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=702846&group_id=30144&atid=398385

2003-03-13 11:06  ircdome

	* source/modules/mod.nick/nick.cpp: 
	
	Fixed bugs in info/ghost commands. Details at
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=702872&group_id=30144&atid=398385

2003-03-13 11:02  ircdome

	* source/: lib/database/mysql/dbmysql.cpp,
	modules/mod.nick/nick.cpp: 
	
	Fixed the null pointer bug in /msg nick kill (See :
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=702884&group_id=30144&atid=398385
	) for reference.
	
	Added a user+pass check to the function, and tidied up the null
	pointer check

2003-03-13 10:22  ircdome

	* ChangeLog, source/lib/services.cpp: 
	
	Updating the ChangeLog

2003-03-13 09:28  ircdome

	* source/: lib/console.cpp, modules/mod.chan/chan.cpp: 
	
	Fixed up the console service so it has the same security checks as
	serv and oper.	Basically the following checks are done.
	
	1) Is the user identified? 2) Is the user listed in the access
	table with access to this service? 3) Is the command they are
	trying to do listed in the commands table? (and they have enough
	access for it)
	
	Fixed up an if bug in the channel module which was causing it to
	incorrectly complain about not having access on a parseOP

2003-03-13 09:04  ircdome

	* source/lib/services.cpp: 
	
	Changed the loop time from 360 seconds (5 minutes) to 3600 (one
	hour).
	
	At a later stage I would like to move this to a configuration
	option, either definable via the config file, or from the console
	service.

2003-03-13 09:00  ircdome

	* source/modules/: mod.nick/nick.cpp, mod.oper/oper.cpp,
	mod.oper/oper.h: 
	
	Some tidying up in mod.nick
	
	Added zline/qline/gline commands to mod.oper - nb these are
	designed to work with the ircd we are developing with atm (being
	bahamut), at a later stage these will need to be tweaked once the
	appropiate protocol modules are available for kine.

2003-03-13 07:29  pickle

	* source/modules/mod.game/: README, README.Exordi8: Added docs that
	got removed 5 months ago when the directory structure changed...
	again... and these files got forgotten..... again....

2003-03-12 22:42  ircdome

	* ChangeLog: 
	
	Added the start of a ChangeLog file.
	
	This file is generated on the fly by a program called cvs2cl (see
	http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/)
	
	Everytime it is run (client side), it reviews cvs log messages and
	creates the appropiate ChangeLog file to reflect those changes.
	
	I'll periodically run this file myself to keep the ChangeLog
	uptodate, however if you are going to run it ensure you use the
	--accum option to ensure it only adds what's needed, and doesn't
	rewrite the whole file!

2003-03-12 22:11  ircdome

	* doc/example.conf, source/lib/config.cpp, source/lib/config.h,
	source/lib/services.cpp: 
	
	Added a new config option called defConsoleChan (see example.conf)

2003-03-12 21:55  ircdome

	* doc/example.conf: 
	
	Added the entry for uplinkPass so people know its their :-)

2003-03-12 21:47  ircdome

	* include/exordium/config.h, source/lib/config.cpp,
	source/lib/config.h, source/lib/services.cpp,
	utils/email-sender/mailer.php: 
	
	Added a new config variable for the configuration file:
	
	(String) uplinkPass
	
	Defines the password to be used for connecting to the uplink.
	
	This means developers must have an entry for this in their config
	files else it won't work!!

	* AUTHORS: Uhh, got PLV's email addy wrong...... or did I?...... ;)

2003-03-12 07:56  pickle

	* install/: README, en.exordium.lang: Added an example langtags
	thingy for james to sink his teeth into. Ooohh, it's GPL'd, and
	there's a little idea I had while I was writing it popped in there
	for consideration.. *cough cough* :)
	
	Okay, this is probably better autogen'd (that way, keeping the tags
	updated for all languages would be a LOT easier, since the
	languages which are missing tag data would be found very easily in
	a .def file).. I'm debating the same thing with Kine's language
	files.

	dynamic loader) instead of dlopen() which is a porting nightmare.
	
	Also did a *tiny* clean-up here and there, but nothing special to
	warrant this many words to describe it.

	* With above, I added a 'lovers' table in the love module - it is

2002-10-23 11:02  pickle

	* autogen/fieldtypes.def, include/exordium/database/table.h.tpl:
	Fixed up the DatabaseTable:: class' header template a bit better
	(although it still needs a bit more work to generate properly
	written C++ code - the comma on the last enum value is naughty, but
	my scheme isn't very good)..
	
	I have populated the fieldtypes definition table for autogen with
	values already used by the database, and extended it a bit further
	(such as all the integer types, all string types etc). I have added
	translation data for mysql and postgresql tables, of which I hope
	the postgresql types are actually correct.
	
	BTW, the use of 'DATETIME' in mysql didn't seem as portable as
	'TIMESTAMP' (according to my SQL-92 spec docs too).. So I've
	changed it over to being TIMESTAMP entirely - this way when the
	data is handled within exordium it is consistant, and probably also
	a lot easier/efficient to rip apart.. So anyway, be aware of that
	change.. *sigh* :(

	(config.h) being in the include/exordium directory.
	
	The Config:: class has been turned into a base class for
	ConfigInternal:: to hide many unnecessary variables. This included
	the Modules:: class, of which has had its header moved into the
	library's directory since it is only used internally.
	
	Instead of using the console's hostname for the underling server,
	two new configuration variables have been made - underlingHostname
	and underlingDescription. Both variables relate to the underling
	server. If the hostname is not set, the server will not be created.

	the tables.h file, however it's an autogen template. My reasoning
	is that the types of variables can be automatically mapped using
	autogen for the various database engines (i.e. name = 'Integer';
	mysql_type = 'int'; or something in the definition file). This
	change required the header files to be listed in the top makefile,
	and autogen to be checked in the autoconf script. The addition of
	the header files to the top makefile also allows them to be
	installed automatically now ;)

	already sped up compilation times, although the interface stuff
	still needs a lot of work. Many routines still need to be removed
	and put in other places, such as in their respective modules, etc.
	
	Services::Debug(), Services::helpme() and Services::globop() calls

	come down to there being a conflict. Also, the #define's are given
	a value (1) so that crappy preprocessors actually define it..

	* source/modules/mod.game/: poker.cpp, poker.h: Altered poker to

	However, the console.h file should be in source/lib/. and not in

	Added a libexordium_bank which allows us to use money within
	services.
	
	Added mod.credits which is a user interface to libexordium_bank. 
	Internals should use the library functions directly.

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Changed all the cout's in services:: to
	be logLine()'s..

2002-10-19 17:35  pickle

	* source/module.cpp: Swapped the delete's around to be in reverse

	* source/module.cpp: Stopped services taking control - no run
	function..

2002-10-19 17:27  pickle

	* source/module.cpp: Changed the services new's assert to an if,
	since kine will need to know if it cannot start rather than
	exordium being rude..

2002-10-17 22:17  pickle

	* configure.ac: Shh, pretend it was never there... :)

2002-10-17 22:07  pickle

	* configure.ac: This is a 'half' fix to the mysql checker.. It's
	technically correct, in that it is actually passing the libraries
	and defines properly to the test compile. However, the actual
	problem lies within mysql_config itself.

2002-10-17 21:03  josullivan

	* configure.ac, source/Makefile.am: Fixed the check for
	mysql_config.

2002-10-17 20:03  pickle

	* include/exordium/services.h: Silly conversion - kine's logger
	uses std::string, so exordium's wrapper now does too.

2002-10-17 19:59  pickle

	* include/exordium/: log.h, services.h: Now using kine's loggers
	properly. This is a full logger integration now. A new KineIRCd
	snapshot will be required to compile this change.

2002-10-17 11:05  pickle

	* doc/example.conf: Removed the logfile variable thingy from the

	* configure.ac, source/Makefile.am, source/modules/Makefile.am,
	source/modules/mod.game/Makefile.am,

2002-10-17 09:12  josullivan

	* include/exordium/database/postgresql/dbpgsql.h,
	source/lib/database/postgresql/dbpgsql.cpp: Changed the order of

	it.

2002-10-15 21:22  josullivan

	* source/modules/mod.game/cards/: pack.h, shuffler.h, stock.h:
	Shuffler was turned into a templated function rather than a
	functor.  Updated stock and pack to use the new shuffler.

2002-10-15 20:46  josullivan

	* source/modules/mod.game/cards/shuffler.h: Shuffler functor

2002-10-15 15:11  pickle

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/services.cpp: Did a rough
	cleanup of services.h:
	
	 * Moved a few functions into private: scope, since they were only
	   used internally;
	
	 * Removed/commented out a few functions that have become obsolete,
	or only
	   served a menial purpose with Parser::, which of course is
	temporary;
	
	 * Added a few comments, regarding functions that should be moved
	out of
	   Services:: and into their respective modules;
	
	 * Converted a few functions to static that I knew off the top of
	my head
	   didn't actually use the services structure, but rather serve a
	more
	   utilitarian purpose;
	
	 * Removed the redundant mode queue, which was an addition which
	quickly fell
	   into redundancy considering kine will handle command merging.
	Anything
	   associated with the mode queue has been merged with the real
	output queue;
	
	This small change has actually sliced two minutes off my compile
	time. If someone would like to clean up Services:: properly, it
	would save a lot of time and probably make exordium more
	efficient..

	* include/exordium/log.h, include/exordium/services.h,

	* configure.ac, source/Makefile.am,

2002-10-14 07:18  josullivan

	* source/modules/mod.game/: exordi8.cpp, cards/stock.h: Added a

	Fixed the NULL warning in cards/hand.h

2002-10-13 17:25  pickle

2002-10-13 17:17  pickle

	* source/: module.cpp, version.h: Updated to suit the new module

	long time ago :)

2002-10-09 09:23  josullivan

2002-10-09 06:04  pickle

	* source/modules/mod.game/dice/README: Wrote a little README to
	accompany the lonely looking die.h file - poor guy :( He needs
	another friend I suppose, "dice.h" - to manage multiple dice..	The
	die class, btw, was made with the thought of monopony (and a large
	array of games which could possibly need a dice) coming in the
	future.. otherwise I wouldn't have bothered doing anything with it
	:)

2002-10-09 06:02  pickle

	* source/modules/mod.game/dice/die.h: Wrote die routine (in a
	'Dice' namespace); done with one hand while on the phone to a very
	boring person :)

2002-10-07 12:49  pickle

	* source/module.cpp: Change for Kine API change - moved the
	license/copyright information that was send via std::cout into a
	block used to append to the /INFO information.	Remember that when
	kine is not in debugging mode, stdin, stdout and stderr get closed
	- ultimately the output from exordium to stdout/stderr won't work,
	and naturally won't be visible to people running it. Now it's
	available in the version info block.

2002-10-05 23:05  pickle

	* source/modules/mod.game/cards/card.h: Added an anonymous
	union/struct pair (which HOPEFULLY works - you may need a gcc 3.x
	compiler) to facilitate some speedy copies and black
	initialisations... Well that's the plan anyway, this is a blind
	edit :(

2002-10-05 14:13  pickle

	* source/module.cpp: Slight fix for a small kine api change. Also
	changed a few comments to be a little more relative to the code
	surrounding them

2002-10-05 04:06  josullivan

	* source/modules/mod.game/cards/: pack.cpp, pack.h: Altered
	Cards::Pack so that, though french cards will be standard, you can
	inherit from this class to create other packs.. ie. German which
	will be used in Karnoffel.

	it as a placeholder.

2002-10-04 09:24  josullivan

	* source/modules/mod.game/: exordi8.cpp, cards/hand.h: Added
	Cards::Card getCardAtIndex(unsigned int) which retrieves a card by

2002-10-03 14:11  pickle

	* include/exordium/database/: mysql/dbmysql.h,

	parser.h, service.h, services.h, user.h, database/base.h,
	database/database.h, database/mysql/dbmysql.h,
	database/postgresql/dbpgsql.h: A few (sort of) minor things:  *
	Removed 'using ...' keywords from headers - they are dangerous
	there, and    should never be used in headers unless embedded
	within a class or    structure definition (i.e. the scope of the
	keyword is limited to the    header alone).   * A few const fixes  
	* Moved Config& and Log& references into the base class (since all 
	   inherited classes need them)   * Minor header fixes
	(technicality really) - When included by external code	   from the
	library they should be referenced as if they were installed. This  
	  doesn't apply to the library code itself, of course.	 * Moved
	sets of assignment operators into the initialisation bracket of a  
	  class (much faster class initialisation)   * Moved #.. calls that
	weren't starting at char #1 to the front of the     line. Many
	compilers' pre-processors cannot chew on them unless the # is	 
	the first character on the line and makes it not very portable,
	however     white-space between the # and the tag is portable.	 *
	Added missing void's in prototypes without parameters	* Added
	missing destructors

2002-10-03 12:11  pickle

	* doc/example.conf, include/exordium/conf.h, source/module.cpp,

	predominantly the fact that some modules were nesting themselves
	inside the Exordium namespace which is exclusively drawn our for
	libexordium and *not* the modules. I also created a small notice in
	the kine module .cpp file (source/module.cpp) which notes that the
	anonymous namespace for that module is intentional.

	from the modules' perspective it should look upon libexordium as if
	it's already installed, practically as if it's a system library.
	When compiling inside the Exordium package, the -I compiler
	parameter over-rides the compiler looking at the system headers.
	This is ultimately a technicality, but provides a much better
	example to outside parties who may install exordium and begin
	development on their own module(s).

2002-10-02 04:55  pickle

	* .cvsignore: Added evil automake/autoconf related files to the

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Wrote a little notice for other developers
	to read to create an understanding about why the parser seems so
	dodgey. Everyone seems to complain about the parser ;)

	* configure.ac: 
	
	Few fixes.

2002-09-29 04:04  pickle

	* configure.ac, configure.in, dev.sh: Fixed up the configure script
	to suit more modern GNU automake/autoconf standards - this included
	removing the obsolete form of AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE and renaming the
	configure script to configure.ac instead of configure.in.. :(

	Modules register what events they want to receive in their own

	Modules:: will decide what to pass down to the modules in terms of
	virtual functions, the next cvs commit will give a working example.

	kine :-)   To insert a service: eventList[myevent].push_back(my
	service);   To see the first Service entry for event 0:

2002-09-26 03:50  pickle

	* source/: Makefile.am, modules/Makefile.am: Changed 'libservices'
	to 'libexordium'. Why? There is already a 'libservices' (ref:
	sourceforge/freshmeat/countless other websites). The existing
	libservices has been around for over a year and a half now, and the

	* doc/linkmap.dat: Added a few missing bits to the graph, and added
	some coding to denote optional libraries and which are dynamically
	loaded shared objects and which are run-time-linked (libraries)..
	
	Also added a few bits which should sort out this graph working with
	neato.	Neato generates a more compressed graph however it's a
	little harder to read. However, since the graph is technically
	directional (it points down the chain of linked objects) it's
	probably better to keep it as a dot formed graph anyway.

2002-09-23 06:15  pickle

	* source/lib/conf.cpp: Re-ordered to be in alphabetical order

	* source/lib/: conf.cpp, service.cpp: Changed a few config defines

	since engine=<mydb> isnt present in config file

2002-09-22 16:57  pvincent

	* doc/Database-Public-Api, include/exordium/database/database.h:

	somewhat, it is possible ( ;) ) that you find bugs, like a typo in

	example.conf too, there's a new line. It is _very_ verbose right
	now, all queries are shown and logged. If you find a bug plz tell
	me :)  Basically the new configure.in has code to check if u have
	the libs for MySQL and PostgreSQL, it will compile with support
	according to the result. You must choose what DB to use in the
	.conf in the sql subsection, engine=mysql or engine=postgresql,
	i'll start writing the API's documentation ASAP..

2002-09-21 22:56  pickle

	* doc/linkmap.dat: Uhh, oops, fixed a few oversights :)

2002-09-21 11:55  pickle

	* doc/linkmap.dat: Added the kine/exordium/library linkage map
	thingy.. after I cleaned it up a little..
	
	This is basically a directional graph to show how parts of the
	software depend on each other. Objects which use something from
	another object will point to it, such as Kine's library using
	dlopen() to open modules - libkineircd points to libdl.
	
	Grab graphviz from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
	and have a look. Perhaps a generated graph should be posted
	somewhere on the sourceforge website to more clearly explain how
	modular exordium is..

	functions. They now have a reason string sent to them, and are no
	longer required (no longer a pure virtual in the Service:: class)..
	I don't like the way they quit, but they unload neatly.. Upon
	services shutdown they don't seem to manage sending out their quit
	reasons, but it's technically correct and should work okay after
	the transition to kine is complete (whenever that will be) :(
	
	This is my last edit for a while..

2002-09-20 17:37  pickle

	* dev.sh: The space after the #! isn't just a pretty formatting
	thing :(

2002-09-20 16:35  pickle

	* doc/example.conf, source/lib/conf.cpp, source/lib/services.cpp:
	Finished the completed configuration binding code (derived from
	Kine's module loading code).
	
	Modules are now configurable, HOWEVER be aware of three things:
	
	 * Inherited Exordium::Service::ConfigData classes will be required
	to copy
	   the existing configuration definition table from
	source/lib/service.cpp
	   and add to THAT. The default variables will need to be filled,
	unless the
	   service is going to break the rules just to confuse the user. At
	least the
	   compiler will force you into providing defaults for those
	values.
	
	 * LibAIS::ConfigParser and associated routines are designed to be
	*PASSIVE*.
	   In this respect, anything unconfigured that requires a value
	must either
	   be given a default in construction (preferred) or checked at
	some stage
	   prior to use to determine whether it has been configured
	(discouraged for
	   values other than booleans).
	
	 * LibAIS::ConfigParser is evolving, and currently will break
	program flow
	   upon a configuration file being loaded with a class it cannot
	configure. To
	   this end, that means missing modules in Exordium configured via
	a full
	   configuration statement (with the braces and in-depth values)
	will make
	   the configuration parser break in a seemingly ugly way. This is
	a temporary
	   thing and will change in future. As stated above, this will
	eventually
	   result simply in the configuration parser sending out a warning
	about the
	   module being unable to load, and continuing on.
	
	Good luck Exordium coders :)

	to service.h

2002-09-20 09:53  ircdome

	* source/: lib/services.cpp, modules/Makefile.am, modules/oper.cpp:
	
	
	Converted the Oper:: module and enabled its compilation in the

	For some reason the validate oper function isn't working as
	desired, basically it tries to validate *every* online person, and

2002-09-19 22:02  ircdome

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/services.cpp,

	Added a getAccess() to Services:: , because sometimes we need to
	find out what access a user has to a service, even when they aren't
	online , thus we can't use findUser().
	
	Started converting the serv module over... still quite a few errors
	so it's commented out of source/modules/Makefile.am , uncomment it
	at your own peril :-)

	reference (which is now a pointer, unfortunately) to being

	initialised, services won't have - this works identical to how
	kine's module system works now, the start() starts the module, and
	init fires it up and gets it ready (and feeds services some much

2002-09-19 10:03  pickle

	* source/Makefile.am: Switched to using kineircd's .la file so it
	*theoretically* does the -rpath stuff automatically... :(

2002-09-18 20:21  ircdome

	* aclocal.m4, configure.in, ltmain.sh: 
	
	Fixed some things I forgot

2002-09-18 20:06  ircdome

	* COPYING, ChangeLog, INSTALL, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, NEWS,
	aclocal.m4, config.guess, config.sub, configure.in, depcomp,
	dev.sh, mkinstalldirs, source/Makefile.am, source/Makefile.in,
	source/lib/Makefile.am, source/lib/Makefile.in,
	source/modules/Makefile.in: 
	Ok - yes its a big commit!
	
	Basically i've changed over to using automake/libtool etc etc etc
	etc.
	
	I haven't used lots of recursing makefiles like we used to because
	it seemed a silly thing to do (apparantly recursive makefiles are
	bad according to GNU ;-) so the source/Makefile.am controls the
	building of all parts of services... this also allows us to let it
	nicely link all the libraries together
	
	All the modules have been renamed to lib_note.so, etc. (including
	mod_exordium -> lib_mod_exordium.so) and *all* of these are now
	placed in source/.libs ..
	
	Have fun..
	
	(Oh btw my version of automake is .. 1.6.3 test and let me know if
	you have probs)

2002-09-18 19:20  ircdome

	* source/lib/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in: 
	
	Completed conversion to automake type stuff... need to fix the
	other dirs, doing it now :-)

2002-09-18 18:17  ircdome

	* configure.in, dev.sh, missing: 
	
	Oh oh - look YET ANOTHER FILE :)

2002-09-18 18:14  ircdome

	* config.guess, config.sub, install-sh: 
	
	According to gnu's docs these files are required for configure ...
	well WE'D BETTER JUST LISTEN TO THEM THEN HAD'T WE????? :-(

2002-09-18 18:08  ircdome

	* configure.in, autoconf/.cvsignore, autoconf/configure.in,
	source/lib/services.cpp: 
	Moved the configure.in into the root... and stuff

2002-09-18 16:36  ircdome

	* source/: lib/parser.cpp, lib/services.cpp, modules/Makefile.in,
	modules/oper.cpp: 
	
	Fixed various bits.. still trying to find the null pointer bit tho
	:-)

2002-09-18 16:01  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: ARGH!! You don't know how insane the lack
	of that space made me!!!! :(

2002-09-18 12:39  ircdome

	* source/lib/user.cpp: 
	
	Temporarily fixed User::modnick - it was always returning false
	thus not initiating an identification request for a registered
	nick.

2002-09-18 11:40  pickle

	* doc/example.conf, include/exordium/conf.h,
	include/exordium/log.h, include/exordium/modules.h,
	include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/ircdome.cpp,
	source/lib/modules.cpp, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/lib/services.cpp: Moved serviceM (modules list) from
	Services:: to Config::, and
	Services::loadModule()/Services::unloadModule() to Modules::. A few
	lines of code needed changing to reflect the relocation, as well as
	a few header file modifications to avoid preinitialisation of
	classes (grr I hate that, I wish CPP could be smarter)..
	
	Nearly there, the service throwing stuff is temporary, that will
	need to be done through start() since the Services:: instance won't
	actually exist at configuration time because of the way kine
	works.. But that's okay :)

2002-09-18 11:19  ircdome

	* autoconf/configure.in, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/lib/user.cpp, source/modules/note.cpp: 
	
	Note is now converted over and loading correctly.
	
	This is an interim cvs - do not update.

2002-09-17 22:09  ircdome

	* source/: lib/services.cpp, modules/Makefile.in, modules/nick.cpp:
	
	
	Finished converting the nick module over to the new User& api
	
	It now compiles correctly etc

2002-09-17 20:42  josullivan

	* Makefile.in, source/Makefile.in, source/lib/Makefile.in,
	source/modules/Makefile.in: make will now quit compiling on an
	error.. and I also fixed clean and distclean

2002-09-17 17:23  pickle

	* include/exordium/user.h: Why is it the small things that I screw
	up so easily? :(

2002-09-17 17:19  pickle

	* include/exordium/user.h: Fixed embarrasingly stupid bug :(

2002-09-17 14:45  pickle

	source/modules/nick.cpp, source/modules/note.cpp,
	source/modules/oper.cpp, source/modules/serv.cpp,
	source/modules/stats.cpp, source/modules/vote.cpp: Added start and
	stop functions. Can someone have a look at the fixed up
	Modules::Module::~Module? (modules.cpp) - it seems a little ill, I
	think there's a delete on services prior to then, I don't know..
	Perhaps James would know better??

2002-09-17 13:14  pickle

	* source/lib/modules.cpp: Added a hard delete function upon
	Modules:: destruction :(

2002-09-17 13:04  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Another fix..

2002-09-17 12:52  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Added a quick fix..
	
	Why?
	
	Let's examine what was happening:
	
	You'd execute a command in a channel:	.access
	
	Services would be 'smart' and send a message from the target of the
	message, but the target was a channel! So the channel can't talk
	the remote server would end up ignoring it and trying to KILL it :(
	
	So anyway, yes.. a quick fix :) This is why game's commands aren't
	working - something is making services think game is offline... I'm
	too lazy to bother with it just now..

	currently only contains minor version info, someone should probably
	extend it later to include author, descriptor, copyright..
	whatever..

2002-09-17 10:33  pickle

	* source/lib/: modules.cpp, services.cpp: Quick cleanup..

2002-09-17 10:26  pickle

	* include/exordium/modules.h, source/lib/Makefile.in,
	source/lib/modules.cpp: Moved module routines out into a separate

	enough and are a bit 'bulky' to be inlined anyway :(

	source/modules/note.cpp, source/modules/oper.cpp,
	source/modules/serv.cpp, source/modules/stats.cpp,
	source/modules/vote.cpp: Removed the Module:: class, renamed the
	Core:: class to the Modules:: class and broke it into its own
	header file. Changed the interface so that Module:: wasn't
	requried, since back when it was the names given to modules were
	hard-coded (ewwwwwwwwwww!), so it was unnecessary. Also, the double
	new call within modules has been changed to reflect this. It should
	work, I've given it a quick test but not a real test (since I can't
	connect to the database server just yet while James installs
	GenToo)..
	
	The work continues..

2002-09-17 05:22  pickle

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Added additional parenthesis to assert

	Services::log to take User as its first argument

2002-09-17 03:24  pvincent

	* source/lib/: parser.cpp, user.cpp: Fixed validateOper on new
	nick, was passing empty string..

2002-09-17 00:45  josullivan

	source/lib/parser.cpp, source/lib/services.cpp,
	source/lib/user.cpp, source/modules/bot.cpp,
	source/modules/chan.cpp: 1) Changed doHelp to take User as it's
	first argument instead of a nick string 2) Removed getLanguage from
	services and implemented it in user 3) Updated modules to reflect
	changes to doHelp

	Added table onlineopers (functionnal, maybe we'll have to add some
	fields in it.., mode 'o' now checked on new user (NICK), chans are
	deleted from onlinechan upon part if empty

2002-09-16 20:32  josullivan

	* AUTHORS: Added my details

2002-09-16 11:49  ircdome

	* AUTHORS, source/lib/services.cpp: 
	
	Just some small changes.

2002-09-16 10:12  pickle

	* include/exordium/service.h: Moved services and myName variables
	into the Service:: class (why repeat ourselves?).. this is the
	start of using inheritance in a nice polite way to avoid repeated
	code and minimise maintenance..

2002-09-16 10:10  pickle

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Added error message output to the
	socket.connect() error (even tho it's most likely not an error but
	a warning saying the operation is in progress.. the socket is
	non-blocking remember)

2002-09-16 09:33  pickle

	* source/lib/user.cpp: Added extra parenthesis around a while()
	statement to ensure assignment and boolean evaluation

2002-09-16 09:25  pickle

	* source/modules/Makefile.in: Commented out nick/note since they're
	still incomplete... No point trying to compile unfinished work in
	the CVS if it's going to break the compile :(

2002-09-16 09:24  pickle

	* include/exordium/conf.h, source/lib/conf.cpp: Re-ordered the
	definitions in the configuation class and table to be in
	alphabetical order (this IMHO makes it much much *MUCH* easier to
	maintain).  Also added defaults for parameters which do not have
	defaults since the LibAIS::ConfigParser routines are passive by
	nature - they do not in any way guarantee a value being set or not

2002-09-16 09:18  pickle

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Added a return to shut gcc up :( James,
	you should reconsider that function's design ..

2002-09-16 09:17  pickle

	* source/lib/channel.cpp: Added additional parenthesis around an
	while() statement to assert assignment and boolean evaluation

2002-09-16 07:32  josullivan

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Changed string to String

2002-09-16 03:42  pvincent

	* include/exordium/channel.h, include/exordium/user.h,
	source/lib/channel.cpp, source/lib/parser.cpp, source/lib/user.cpp:
	Completed user mode change, now updates table onlineclients

2002-09-16 01:01  pvincent

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/lib/services.cpp: update DB on nick change, client quit,
	server squit

2002-09-16 00:35  pickle

	* autoconf/configure.in: Commented out troublesome getloadavg test
	(this may be simply an autoconf 2.54 bug though)

2002-09-15 21:28  pickle

	* source/lib/conf.cpp: Added a few comments about a few of the
	config entries, since they're temporary and kine already provides
	some of them (servicesHostname and servicesDescription technically
	could already be daemon.getConfig().getOptionsServerName() and
	daemon.getConfig().getOptionsDescription() respectively..

2002-09-15 17:51  pickle

	* include/exordium/sql.h, source/lib/services.cpp,
	source/modules/Makefile.in: Made Sql::makeSafe() static since it
	needs no access to its own class

2002-09-15 17:46  pvincent

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/lib/services.cpp: Added UPDATE query on nick change, added
	stripping for @+ together

2002-09-15 15:51  pickle

	source/modules/nick.cpp, source/modules/note.cpp,
	source/modules/oper.cpp, source/modules/serv.cpp,
	source/modules/stats.cpp, source/modules/vote.cpp: Fixed stuff
	necessary for new kine (much of kine was broken out to libais).  I
	have also cleaned up a few headers, and removed any using
	<whatever>'s from headers I saw (naughty James, naughty!)...
	
	Note: You will need the latest libais and kineircd to get this to
	compile now!

2002-09-15 14:33  ircdome

	* source/modules/nick.cpp: 
	
	More changes on converting nick.

2002-09-15 11:08  ircdome

	* source/modules/: Makefile.in, nick.cpp: 
	
	Broken Commit - Just a safety thing incase my hard-drive blows up
	and shatters into little tiny fragments before i get chance to
	commit again (.. well you never know)
	
	In the middle of converting the nickname module over to ptr
	thingies :(

2002-09-15 09:07  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Did a double-up on the string tokens
	creation because of the dodgey way channel commands are thrown to
	services :(

2002-09-15 04:07  pvincent

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Removing debug stuff (...)

2002-09-15 04:03  pvincent

	* source/lib/: parser.cpp, services.cpp: Fixed the cant find user
	error on sjoin and fixed inconsistency in nickname passing
	(sometimes passed as myname and other times @myname)

2002-09-15 02:54  pvincent

	* doc/example.conf, include/exordium/services.h,
	source/lib/conf.cpp: Modified HOSTNAME to SERVICESHOSTNAME and
	DESCRIPTION to SERVICESDESCRIPTION for the sake of clarity. Updated
	the example.conf

2002-09-15 01:02  pvincent

	* doc/example.conf, include/exordium/conf.h, source/lib/conf.cpp,
	source/lib/services.cpp: Added options HOSTNAME, DESCRIPTION,
	CONSOLEHOSTNAME and CONSOLEDESCRIPTION. Updated the example.conf

2002-09-15 00:33  pvincent

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Forgot to remove a debug cout (...)

2002-09-15 00:31  pvincent

	* source/lib/: parser.cpp, services.cpp: Fixed
	services::isAuthorised() to work in case the table is empty (ie
	initial start)

2002-09-14 22:45  ircdome

	* source/: lib/services.cpp, modules/Makefile.in, modules/chan.cpp:
	
	
	Converted chan over to use the new User stuff
	
	There is an error with in channel parsing (i.e .access in a
	channel) will crash services, but according to the backtrace this
	is an error in game (can you look simon?)
	
	James.

2002-09-14 21:04  ircdome

	* source/: lib/services.cpp, modules/bot.cpp: 
	
	Ok.
	
	For the time being I have had to remove the self registration of
	modules (i.e where they use registerService) because for some
	FUCKED up reason the queueAdd's that they are doing are getting a
	higher priority then the ALREADY SENT queueadd's from services.. so
	we end with a server chatter like so:
	
	:NICK game BLAH BLAH BLAH :NICK love BLAH BLAH BLAH :PASS PASS :TS
	:SERVER services.ircdome.org
	
	Screwed aye? I couldn't figure out - perhaps I'm just too tired.

2002-09-14 20:52  pvincent

	* include/exordium/conf.h, source/lib/conf.cpp,
	source/lib/services.cpp: Added UplinkPort config option and
	un-hardcoded host/port

2002-09-14 20:41  ircdome

	* source/lib/: parser.cpp, services.cpp: [no log message]

2002-09-14 19:32  ircdome

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/channel.cpp,
	source/lib/ircdome.cpp, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/lib/services.cpp: 
	
	Broken CVS - don't check out unless you want to fix a few bugs.

2002-09-14 16:25  ircdome

	* include/exordium/nickname.h, source/lib/Makefile.in,
	source/lib/nickname.cpp:

2002-09-14 15:31  ircdome

	* include/exordium/services.h, include/exordium/user.h,
	source/lib/services.cpp, source/lib/user.cpp: 
	
	Have shifted a lot more Nickname:: functions over into User::
	
	*warning* i haven't removed the unresolved defines in nickname.h so
	this will proberly generate unresolved symbols and stuff..  i'll do
	that shortly after i've finished the last 12 or so functions in
	nickname::

2002-09-14 12:50  ircdome

	* source/lib/services.cpp: 
	
	:-)

2002-09-14 10:15  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Umm.. not the origin, the newNick simon..
	the NEW nick :(

2002-09-14 10:06  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: I think that should have added the client
	properly...

2002-09-14 10:02  pickle

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/services.cpp: OH I SEE..
	oh well, needed cleaning up anyway - two iterations through the
	list to add a user, pfft :( That addUser() thingy would probably be
	best suited to being inline, or inside addClient() (to avoid people
	getting confused like I just did)

2002-09-14 09:59  pickle

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/lib/services.cpp: Fiddled with addUser()'n stuff :( James
	you need to add the SQL stuff, read the comment :(

2002-09-14 09:52  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Added a few sanity checky thingies, and
	cleaned up a few thingies as I went.. but otherwise it really needs
	something to ADD the user to the users list James :)

2002-09-14 05:48  pickle

	* source/lib/parser.cpp: Correction necessary to compile (thanks to
	Peter!)

2002-09-13 18:03  ircdome

	* include/exordium/parser.h, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/lib/user.cpp: 
	
	This commit is broken.
	
	(& -> * crap)
	
	We couldn't obtain the user pointer at the top of Parser:: because
	you aren't guaranteed to be working with a user (could be a server)

2002-09-13 14:03  ircdome

	* source/lib/services.cpp: 
	
	Temp fix only .. will remove later..

2002-09-13 13:37  pickle

	* source/lib/: nickname.cpp, services.cpp: Changed the utils.h
	include to point to the REAL utils.h (kine's)

2002-09-13 13:33  pickle

	* include/exordium/channel.h, include/exordium/conf.h,

	boiler plates once and for all (I hope)

2002-09-13 13:22  pickle

	* include/exordium/utils.h: Removed because it's really a part of
	kine.. and this was outdated I think..

2002-09-13 13:12  pickle

	* source/modules/config.log: Removed this weird file (from
	autoconf? weird that this was here..)

2002-09-13 13:05  pickle

	* source/modules/Makefile.in: Uncommented game/love - they should
	be working now.

2002-09-13 12:48  pickle

	* include/exordium/user.h: Added an equal-to operator for my own
	sanity..

2002-09-13 11:32  pickle

	* include/exordium/nickname.h, include/exordium/parser.h,
	include/exordium/service.h, source/lib/parser.cpp,
	source/modules/bot.cpp: Started moving over to using User:: in
	modules (and StringTokens::)..	HOWEVER.. JAMES: FIX YOUR
	UNRESOLVED SYMBOLS - How much code is missing from the
	repository?!?!

2002-09-13 10:51  pickle

	* include/exordium/user.h: Okay, I got a little excited. Since I
	know you use -Werror james i'll stop it from generating errors.

	source/modules/nick.cpp: 
	
	More moving towards lovley nickname objects !
	
	You'll see that a pointer to the nickname class is now inside
	Parser:: I have not yet replaced origin with it.. as I intend to
	run both Nickname api's (being the services.getNickname()) crap and
	the new ptr->crap methods along side each other until the
	transition of functions from Nickname:: -> User:: is complete.

	Ok!
	
	I have created the UserBase:: and User:: class ... its kinda hard
	to explain what they are, the code itself is well documentated ..
	and makes good sense to me!
	
	In the next commit you'll see Nickname:: functions ported over to
	User:: functions allowing us to do things like User *ptr =
	services.clients.findUser("james"); ptr->sendMessage("fooo","chan")
	
	... as an example of course :)

	From memory, there are several bug fixes, as well as the initial

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/lib/Makefile.in,
	source/lib/channel.cpp, source/lib/services.cpp,
	source/modules/Makefile.in, source/modules/serv.cpp: 
	
	Fixed shutdown sequence. You now called Services::shutdown(void)
	when you wish to initiate a services shutdown (make sure you send
	all relevant notices BEFORE calling this).
	
	Fixed the silly bug when removing bans (bans now removed properly
	from channels)
	
	Tidied something up that raff mentioned, but I can't rememer it now
	
	Fixed some sql bugs (which simon demonstrated via topic bugs) - the
	solution at present isn't as nice as i would like, but at least the
	bug itself is finished.
	
	Added serv DIE command - currently set to level 400, you must give
	the reason for shutdown i.e /msg serv die because we're upgrading!!
	:)

2002-08-11 16:28  simonb

	source/lib/channel.cpp, source/lib/nickname.cpp,

	source/modules/chan.cpp, source/modules/serv.cpp: 
	Started to tidy up the messages coming back from services - trying
	to adopt a more 'smarter' and 'generic' look, please adopt these.
	
	Tidied up the Channel ban code, if only a nickname is given, then
	services will ban their host.
	
	Channel bans now expire (by default only 120 seconds - but thats
	partly due to testing, and also due to the fact i couldn't decide
	how to allow a user settable expire (in terms of syntax))
	
	Added a channel command listban/.listban to list the current bans
	in a channel.
	
	Added the starts of a news system (as can be seen by the annoying
	news items on signup :D), it supports three levels, those being
	0=all users, 1=services helpers, 2=irc operators, giving the
	appropiate news to each type of user as they signon(or +h/oper up).
	
	I don't even know why im waffling on here, since I bet im the only
	one who reads this :)
	
	GOODNIGHT!

	* include/exordium/channel.h, include/exordium/ircdome.h,
	include/exordium/module.h, include/exordium/nickname.h,
	include/exordium/parser.h, include/exordium/services.h,
	include/exordium/utils.h, source/lib/channel.cpp,

	source/modules/bot.cpp, source/modules/chan.cpp,
	source/modules/nick.cpp, source/modules/note.cpp,
	source/modules/serv.cpp: Fixed kine's header defines (i.e. #include
	"kineircd/str.h" -> #include <kineircd/str.h") since it was causing
	some issues with my manual installation of kine (I was testing)...

2002-07-28 09:57  simonb

	* source/Makefile.in: Switched to generating smod_exordium.so
	instead of mod_exordium.so (to match kine style - smod = service
	module)

2002-07-27 18:29  simonb

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Changed dlopen() call from using
	RTLD_LAZY to RTLD_NOW - Look at all the symbol linking problems
	which seemed like bugs James!! :(

2002-07-26 13:32  simonb

	* include/exordium/conf.h, include/exordium/log.h,
	source/module.cpp, source/lib/conf.cpp, source/lib/log.cpp,
	source/lib/sql.cpp: A handful of configuration fixes:
	
	 * Removed uplinkhost variable, it was obsolete and wasn't even
	used! Kine
	   will eventually deal with this, so the setting remaining
	hard-coded is no
	   real issue
	
	 * Make the logfile variable ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING! This is
	achieved by
	   throwing a reference to the Config:: instance at the Log::init()
	function
	   and also through the new getLogfile() thing.
	
	 * Migrated mysql* variables into an sql {}; class (and renamed
	them and their
	   'get' functions subsequently).

2002-07-25 20:39  james

	* source/: main.cpp, lib/services.cpp: 
	Removed configuration parser.
	
	Removed main.cpp

2002-07-25 19:42  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Removed the temporary debugging thingy which
	outputted the kine configuration state.. it's no longer needed

2002-07-25 19:38  simonb

	* include/exordium/services.h, include/exordium/sql.h,
	source/module.cpp, source/lib/services.cpp, source/lib/sql.cpp:
	Migrated to using Kine's configuration parser - WOO! it worked! The
	old configuration parser (now obsolete) and it's variables are
	commented out (services.h/services.cpp).

2002-07-25 18:02  simonb

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/module.cpp: Added a reference
	thingy to the configuration class' instance for Services:: so that
	those friendly fellows can look at the configuration stuff.

2002-07-25 17:51  simonb

	* include/exordium/conf.h, source/module.cpp, source/lib/conf.cpp:
	Forgot two fields :( Also updated module.cpp to tell Kine where to
	find the definition table

2002-07-25 17:42  simonb

	* include/exordium/conf.h, source/module.cpp,
	source/lib/Makefile.in, source/lib/conf.cpp: Started adding stuff
	that integrates with Kine's configuration parser

2002-07-25 15:40  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Sorry, jumped the gun on the compile. This one
	compiles :)

2002-07-25 15:23  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Removed the manditory configuration flag,
	modules will have to deal with it themselves (sorry) :(

2002-07-25 15:21  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Quick (rough) cleanup; Added a services
	pointer so that a new instance of the Services:: class can be
	neatly deleted upon the moduleStop() function being called.

2002-07-25 15:10  simonb

	* include/exordium/services.h, source/Makefile.in,
	source/module.cpp, source/lib/services.cpp: Obsoleted main.cpp :(
	Well not entirely, but soon enough :( I added a tiny contructor to
	Services:: which accepts a reference to Kine's daemon (passed when
	the module initialises). When the configuration thing is done the
	Services::init() function can be totally replaced by the destructor
	all on its own. I moved the signal handler assignment stuff from
	the Services::run() function into Services::init() (at the top) and
	removed the self-initialisation of a Kine::Signals:: class; Now it
	uses the given daemon reference to jump into the daemon's signal
	handler so it can integrate in a friendly way. I also added
	Services::getDaemon() to return the reference - not really a
	protection device but rather an implementation protection device. I
	have used getDaemon() in Services::init() to save any future
	maintenance issues, i.e. if the Daemon type changes it's only a
	quick edit of the getDaemon() function to restore functionality.
	
	I strongly encourage you to migrate stuff to being non-static :( It
	would allow you to break stuff up into smaller chunks James :(

2002-07-24 10:39  james

	* include/exordium/mysql.h: 
	Changed something

2002-07-24 07:49  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Added the basic info extension for the basic
	information structure. This will be used to define where the
	configuration information structure is for kine's configuration
	parser

2002-07-23 06:49  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Added the mandatory configuration flag.. which
	will be used soon, honest :)

2002-07-23 04:03  simonb

	* source/modules/note.cpp: Okay, so I screwed it up :( All fixed :)

2002-07-23 04:01  simonb

	* source/modules/note.cpp: Made note register himself, I hope..

2002-07-23 03:56  simonb

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Made IRCDome register itself.. again..
	:)

2002-07-22 23:47  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Did the 'proper thing' and moved the local
	stuff into the mod_exordium namespace, a mini-namespace thingy for
	the module <-> services core interface doohickey

2002-07-22 23:27  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Made the start/stop functions static for
	completeness (and security, sort of). The only thing that needs to
	be visible is the module's init function

2002-07-22 22:40  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Added more proof we are tied nicely into the
	kine daemon by pulling information from its configuration (several
	chains away from us) - this is also a mini-example for you, James
	:)

2002-07-22 20:54  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Added proof that the module's start function
	is receiving the reference pointer to the daemon class which is
	going to operate it from hense on...

2002-07-22 18:01  simonb

	* source/modules/serv.cpp: Converted.. sort'a.. so I can fiddle
	with raw :)

2002-07-22 10:32  simonb

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Updated the code for the 'void *foo'
	variable added to the signal handler structure. Services will now
	use the foo variable to know about the Services:: instance blah
	blah blah blah.. you get the idea :) Now services can do something
	with the signals a little smarter than previously

2002-07-22 09:05  simonb

	* source/lib/sql.cpp: Fixed the time thing.. again.. I didn't
	multiply the microseconds properly and I added the long-long
	type-cast just in case.. but.. yeah.. so much for rushed hacks :)

2002-07-22 08:32  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Added a return value (true for now) to the
	start function.. even if it is quite meaningless at the moment,
	it's more correct! :)

2002-07-22 06:22  simonb

	* source/module.cpp: Added the unique instance flag (I'm pretty
	sure exordium only needs to be loaded once :)

2002-07-20 21:53  james

	* autoconf/configure.in: 
	Opps :)

2002-07-20 21:48  james

	* autoconf/configure.in, include/exordium/config.h,
	source/Makefile, source/Makefile.in, source/lib/Makefile,
	source/lib/Makefile.in, source/modules/Makefile,
	source/modules/Makefile.in: 
	
	Fixing some silly bugs :)

2002-07-20 20:04  simonb

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Added the KINE_ prefix to the
	SIGNAL_HANDLER_FUNC template thingies.. :(

2002-07-20 18:11  james

	* source/: lib/nickname.cpp, modules/chan.cpp: 
	Dunno I can't actually remember - I think it was making chan
	automated registration... :)

2002-07-20 17:52  james

	* source/modules/: bot.cpp, nick.cpp: 
	Converted Nick() to use self registration

2002-07-20 17:42  james

	* source/lib/services.cpp: 
	Removed all registration of services - Modules now have to do it
	themselves.
	
	Added bot + game to initial module loading list.

2002-07-20 17:40  james

	* include/exordium/nickname.h, source/lib/nickname.cpp,
	source/modules/bot.cpp, source/modules/chan.cpp,
	source/modules/nick.cpp: 
	Converted Bot() to use self registration

2002-07-20 10:38  james

	* Makefile.in, doc/Functions, include/exordium/config.h,
	source/Makefile, source/module.cpp, source/lib/nickname.cpp,
	source/modules/Makefile, source/modules/nick.cpp: 
	Seperated MSN/AIM
	
	Added appropiate functions to retreive
	
	Added make dump in root to dump the db

2002-07-19 20:58  simonb

	* source/: Makefile.in, module.cpp: Added the start of the
	mod_exordium stuff.. woop woop

2002-07-19 14:38  simonb

	* source/lib/sql.cpp: Fixed, hopefully, the sql time thingy

2002-07-19 14:13  simonb

	* source/lib/services.cpp: Love registers himself now.. herself..
	itself.. what the hell is love?! hermaphrodite to please all? hmm..
	better put some thought into that one..

2002-07-19 14:06  simonb

	* source/modules/: bot.cpp, chan.cpp, nick.cpp, note.cpp, serv.cpp:
	Fart fart fart... oh.. oh I see.. you want me to write something
	meaningful here?
	
	Well.. I REFUSE..
	
	Oh alright.. you win..
	
	I swapped out the service_init shit and replaced it with the
	EXORDIUM_SERVICE_INIT_FUNCTION define usage thingy.. why? MIND YOUR
	OWN BUSINESS
	
	oh.. you want a real answer.. well.. it's more maintainable, and if
	you change the thing it changes all over the package (which means
	nothing left in the stack etc).. blah blah blah, blah bling blah
	blah.

2002-07-19 13:56  simonb

	* include/exordium/services.h: Added a define for the services
	initialisation function, so no more hunting through code and
	editing crap. Is this where you wanted in, though, james?

2002-07-16 21:37  james

	* include/exordium/config.h, source/lib/services.cpp,
	source/modules/Makefile: 
	The init_function for modules is now passed an extra parameter,
	being the name of the module (as referenced from the loadModule
	call)
	
	This enables modules to be non-hardcoded as to their names, thus
	making for lovley clean code!
	
	- Also reabled the forced changing nicks since it was confusing
	services having it disabled, and making it very hard to read debug
	text in #exordium

2002-07-14 14:27  james

	* Makefile.in, include/exordium/config.h,
	include/exordium/service.h, source/modules/Makefile,

	source/modules/Makefile.in: beginning with `CVS:' are removed
	automatically CVS:  CVS: Committing in . CVS:  CVS: Modified Files:
	source/modules/Makefile.in CVS:

	:)

2002-07-14 11:52  simonb

	* source/modules/Makefile.in: Made a real rule to make .so's from
	.cpp's

2002-07-14 11:43  simonb

	* include/exordium/service.h: Made the header a little less
	dependant on everything being set up before it (like using
	Kine::String etc etc) - narky little bugger. This uses fully
	qualified names to get around it, which is how it should be done so
	people don't need to work around qwerks.. This is probably why
	people say 'using' should *never* be used in headers :(
