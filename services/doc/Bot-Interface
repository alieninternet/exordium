This documents purpose is to describe the bot 'friendly' interface to services, designed
to provide a simplier interface to services for those users that wish to run bots.

Queries will only be allowed from nicknames which have the Bot flag enabled on their nickname
(and obviously identified) - Bots would be able to be 'registered' at the services channel, or
via the webpage.

Queries from bots are received by the service 'Bot' in private message format, and formatted as follows:

PRIVMSG Bot :<Numerical Query Code> <Arguments>

The numercial question codes/responses are as follows:

Code	Arguments		Information Requested				Response Codes

100	Single Nickname		Is this person identified as this nickname	0 = Not identified
										1 = Identified as that nick
										2 = Nickname not online
										3 = Nickname not registered

101	Single Nickname		Is this person online				0 = No
										1 = Yes
