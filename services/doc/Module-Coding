Modules require the following;

(o) Linked against libservices.so

(o) A *service_init function, made available externally via extern 
    eg extern "C" Module *service_init(void).  This function must
    register the module - bringing any required 'clients' online
    via calls to the base class Services::
    It must also return a copy of itself via new (return new Module("foo", new foo()); ) 

How to receive commands - aka your parser.

Two functions are required (one an overloaded of the other) - these being
void parseLine (String const &line, String const &origin, String const &chan)
 + void parseLine (String const &line, String const &origin).

&line being the command + any arguments passed.
&origin being the originators nickname
&chan being the channel the command was typed in (if applicable)

The former is used for passing a channel along - i.e if you needed to support in channel
commands.

The latter being the de-facto privmsg interface.

From this point onwards, the structure of the module is complety upto you.

N.B Until the in channel parser is re-written to be more 'clever' no two modules can have the same
'in channel' command name.

For a list of the available functions, exported by exordium for module use, please see the
Functions document.
