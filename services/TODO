Add auto-deidentify on away thing :) - settable via nick set

Add channel topic following - settable via chan set - updates channel topics
in the db when set by .topic /msg chan topic AND normal user topic changes

Upto channel info to show channel settings

Tidy up message reponses from services...

Fix bug where when services voices/deops a user when they go away, we
don't call internalVoice + internalDeop so services still thinks the
user is opped!.

Services needs to track AWAY status - and NOT op etc when an AWAY user 
joins a channel - Possible addition is remebering what channels we deop the
user in - and reopping them when they come back


Monitoring of uplink LAG - And adjust rate out of outgoing commands
accordingly

Add suspension of channel users in the access list - ensure level is locked
to that of the setting nick (i.e only 199 + above could remove the suspend
if a 199 set it)

Serv News needs to tell you if theirs no news items

Add ? support in serv commands, i.e nlist, elist etc 


Tidy up ban code........
